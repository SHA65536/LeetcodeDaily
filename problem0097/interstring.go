https://leetcode.com/problems/interleaving-string/

Given strings s1, s2, and s3, find whether s3 is formed by an interleaving of s1 and s2.
An interleaving of two strings s and t is a configuration where they are divided into non-empty substrings such that:
s = s1 + s2 + ... + sn
t = t1 + t2 + ... + tm
|n - m| <= 1
The interleaving is s1 + t1 + s2 + t2 + s3 + t3 + ... or t1 + s1 + t2 + s2 + t3 + s3 + ...
Note: a + b is the concatenation of strings a and b.
