/*
Implement strStr().
Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.
Clarification:
What should we return when needle is an empty string? This is a great question to ask during an interview.
For the purpose of this problem, we will return 0 when needle is an empty string. This is consistent to C's strstr() and Java's indexOf().

func strStr(haystack string, needle string) int {
	if needle == "" {
		return 0
	}
StartingLetters:
	for i := 0; i < len(haystack)-len(needle)+1; i++ {
		for j := 0; j < len(needle); j++ {
			if haystack[i+j] != needle[j] {
				continue StartingLetters
			}
		}
		return i
	}
	return -1
