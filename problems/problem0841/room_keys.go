/*
There are n rooms labeled from 0 to n - 1Â and all the rooms are locked except for room 0.
Your goal is to visit all the rooms. However, you cannot enter a locked room without having its key.
When you visit a room, you may find a set of distinct keys in it.
Each key has a number on it, denoting which room it unlocks, and you can take all of them with you to unlock the other rooms.
Given an array rooms where rooms[i] is the set of keys that you can obtain if you visited room i,
return true if you can visit all the rooms, or false otherwise.
