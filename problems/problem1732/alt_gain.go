There is a biker going on a road trip. The road trip consists of n + 1 points at different altitudes.
The biker starts his trip on point 0 with altitude equal 0.
You are given an integer array gain of length n where gain[i] is the net gain in altitude between points i​​​​​​ and i + 1 for all (0 <= i < n).
Return the highest altitude of a point.
